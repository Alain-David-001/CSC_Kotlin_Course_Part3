Congratulations! You did a great job and created a working application.
We have put together a few ideas on how you could further improve this project on your own.
These improvements will not be assessed as part of the course.
Some of them may require changes to both the client side (what is displayed in the browser)
and the server side (the application logic).
As we don't cover the client-server architecture in this course,
you could either explore it on your own or implement ideas that don't require investigating third-party code.

**Server improvements:**

- You could add another character to the game with a broader variety of actions.
- You could add more complex logic to scale changes, e.g., generate different types of 
food that influence scales in varied ways.
- Currently, we lose the application state if we turn off the server.
  You could implement a feature to save the current state of the applications in files,
  allowing the data to be retrieved when the server starts up.


**Client improvements:**

- Adding new characters requires improvements to both the server and the client â€” you need 
to upload new pictures and icons, handle new actions, etc.
- You could make the application more dynamic by adding animations for all actions.
