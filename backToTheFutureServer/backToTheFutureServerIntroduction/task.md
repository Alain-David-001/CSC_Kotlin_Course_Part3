### Project description


The project of this lesson is **Tamagotchi**.
This toy was once very popular—a small keychain device that lets you take care of a virtual pet.
In our case, we will be looking after a little corgi called Andy.
The main goal of this project is to go back in time and
study two very important approaches in programming—FIFO and LIFO.

### Lesson topics

- FIFO (First-In-First-Out) approach
- LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) approach

### Project example

By the end of this task, you will create the following application:
