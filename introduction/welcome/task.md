Hello! Welcome to the third module of the **"Kotlin Onboarding"** course.
This module will introduce you to the definitions of **collections** in the Kotlin language
and will teach you how to work with them.
**We assume that you have completed the [first](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/21067-kotlin-onboarding-introduction) and [second](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/21913-kotlin-onboarding-object-oriented-programming) parts of the course
or are familiar with all the topics they cover.**

All topics will be accompanied by links to [the official Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html),
which you can read later.

Each lesson of the course is built in the form of a project:
step by step, by completing different small tasks,
you will get a fully working project in the end.
Some of the projects are practice-based and introduce to you
different helpful Kotlin functions though practical exercises without much theory part.
The topic of this module is _Next to the future_.
It means that in each lesson, you will create a web application with
some images familiar from your (or your parents') childhood.
Note, part of the code will be prewritten by the course author
to avoid going deep into web programming in this course.
