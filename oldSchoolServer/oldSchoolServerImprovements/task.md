Congratulations! You did a great job and created a working application.
We have put together a few ideas on how you could further improve this project on your own.
These improvements will not be assessed as part of the course.
Some of them may require changes to both the client side (what is displayed in the browser)
and the server side (the application logic).
As we don't cover the client-server architecture in this course,
you can either explore it on your own or implement ideas that don't require investigating third-party code.

**Server improvements:**

- You could add more complex logic for group-by or search operations.
- You could add the ability to upload your own photo.
- Currently, we lose the application state if we turn off the server.
  You could implement a feature that saves the current state of the applications in files â€”
  then, when the server starts up again, this data can be retrieved.


**Client improvements:**

- You could make the application come alive by adding animations for all actions.
- To simplify the process of uploading a new photo, you could add a special button for it.
